## Description
The kindergarden is understaffed and you are seriously outnumbered by these pesky, little rascals.

Keep them out of harms way! These restless rugrats canâ€™t wait to explore the world. They will run into traffic, drink bleach, eat poisonous mushrooms, stick cutlery into the electrical outlets or run with scissors.

Like most toddlers they also need nutrition! Make sure you pick up a cookie in the kitchen and hand it to toddlers when they get hungry. And finally, remember to clean up their poopy pants before they get a bacterial infection.

Good luck!
